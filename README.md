Use 'courses.csv' or 'courses.json' and click on 'view' to see the data from a file on the app 
Use the 'clear' button to clear the data
Use the save button to open the dialog to save the data in csv or json format respectively,
I have used clean architecture and with that room database to save the data, the room database part is still not full implemented but the basic structure is ready.
